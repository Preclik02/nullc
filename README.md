**THIS IS NOT RELEATED TO NESC IN ANY WAY**

## NullC

NullC is a wrapper around C with some basic changes... nothing hard not even custom compiler.
I (preclik02) made this because I wanted to change some C syntax. Not that its simple now but I just like the shorter version of it.
Like from printf to out is kinda huge like I kinda feel proud about this even tho its simple just like I can code in what I want to is cool.
If you want more info or something dm me on discord (_preclik).

This is also good thing to have when using Null the shell emulator or however you would like to call it.
Also I made this thing to learn something new not to do something new or better than C.
If you want to contribute to this shit feel free to make PR.
